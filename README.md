## 📌 Overview

ComicVerse ML Continuum is an interactive web application that fuses the worlds of Marvel and DC superheroes with powerful machine learning algorithms. Through engaging superhero-themed interfaces, users can explore different ML techniques - with each hero representing a unique algorithm. Batman brings Linear Regression, Spider-Man offers Logistic Classification, and Thanos demonstrates K-Means Clustering, all within a visually stunning comic-inspired interface.

## ✨ Features

- **🦇 Superhero ML Algorithms**: Each hero brings a unique ML superpower
- **🧪 Interactive Data Preprocessing**: Clean and transform your data with superhero assistance
- **🤖 Multiple Data Sources**: Upload your own data, fetch stock prices, or use sample datasets
- **📈 Comic-Themed Visualizations**: Beautiful hero-styled data visualizations
- **📊 Complete Model Evaluation**: Comprehensive performance metrics for each algorithm
- **💾 Hero-Powered Exports**: Download your analysis with themed export options

## 🛠️ Installation

```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/comicverse-ml-continuum.git
cd comicverse-ml-continuum

# Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 📋 Requirements

The application requires the following Python packages:

streamlit>=1.10.0
pandas>=1.4.0
numpy>=1.22.0
plotly>=5.5.0
scikit-learn>=1.0.0
matplotlib>=3.5.0
yfinance>=0.1.70
openpyxl>=3.0.9
pillow>=9.0.0
seaborn>=0.11.0

## 🚀 Usage

1. Launch the application:

```bash
bashstreamlit run main.py
```

2. Access the app in your browser (https://comicverse-ml-continuum-uns4ktyas8gpy4dckzjcp8.streamlit.app/?page=welcome)

3. Navigate to the Mission Control home screen
Choose your data source:
Upload your own CSV/Excel file
Fetch real-time stock data from Yahoo Finance
Use pre-generated sample datasets


4. Select your superhero (algorithm) based on your analysis needs:

Batman for regression problems (predicting continuous values)
Spider-Man for classification problems (binary predictions)
Thanos for clustering tasks (finding patterns in unlabeled data)
Follow your chosen hero's guided workflow to analyze your data

## 🔋 Superhero ML Powers

## 🦇 Batman: Linear Regression
The Dark Knight brings detective precision to predict continuous values:

Feature selection and coefficient analysis
Advanced residual investigation
Predictive modeling with R², MSE and RMSE metrics
Visualization of actual vs. predicted values

## 🕸️ Spider-Man: Logistic Regression

The Web-Slinger uses his Spider-Sense for binary classification:

Categorical feature handling with label encoding
Confusion matrix analysis with precision and recall
ROC curve visualization with AUC metrics
Probability-based predictions with interactive gauge

## 💎 Thanos: K-Means Clustering

The Mad Titan brings perfect balance through unsupervised learning:

Optimal cluster determination
2D and 3D cluster visualization
Silhouette score analysis
Radar charts of cluster profiles
New data point classification

## 🎮 Superhero Mission Control

The central hub offers several options:

Hero Selection: Choose your superhero based on your analysis needs
Data Sources: Multiple ways to upload or generate data
Universe Selection: Explore both Marvel and DC heroes (with more coming soon)
Customize Experience: Set test sizes, feature selections, and preprocessing options
