🦸‍♂️ Overview
ComicVerse ML Continuum is an interactive web application that combines the power of Marvel and DC superheroes with machine learning algorithms! This unique educational tool helps users understand different ML techniques through engaging superhero-themed interfaces.

Each superhero brings their own "superpower" in the form of a specific machine learning algorithm:

🦇 Batman (DC): Linear Regression - Predict continuous values with detective precision
🕸️ Spider-Man (Marvel): Logistic Regression - Classify data with spider-sense accuracy
💎 Thanos (Marvel): K-Means Clustering - Create perfectly balanced data groupings
✨ Features
Interactive ML Model Building: Train models, visualize results, and make predictions in real-time
Multiple Data Sources:
Upload your own CSV/Excel files
Fetch real-time stock data from Yahoo Finance
Use pre-generated sample datasets
Data Preprocessing Tools: Handle missing values, select features, and transform data
Rich Visualizations: Beautiful Plotly charts adapted to each superhero's theme
Superhero Quotes: Enjoy ML-adapted quotes from your favorite heroes
Export Functionality: Download your analysis results in various formats
🔧 Installation
Prerequisites
Python 3.7+
pip package manager
Step 1: Clone the repository
bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/comicverse-ml-continuum.git
cd comicverse-ml-continuum
Step 2: Install dependencies
bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
🚀 Usage
Running the application
bash
streamlit run main.py
The application will open in your default web browser at http://localhost:8501.

Navigation
Start at Mission Control to select your data source and get an overview
Choose your superhero (algorithm) based on your analysis needs:
Batman for predicting continuous values (regression)
Spider-Man for binary classification
Thanos for grouping similar data points (clustering)
Follow the guided process to preprocess your data, train models, and visualize results
Make new predictions with your trained models
Export your analysis or switch heroes to try a different algorithm
